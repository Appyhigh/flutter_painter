A pure-Flutter package for painting. 

## Summary

`flutter_painter` provides you with a widget that can be used to draw on it. Right now, it supports:
- **Free-style drawing**: Scribble anything you want with any width and color.
- **Text**: Add text of any `TextStyle` onto the drawing and control its position, size and rotation in a way you're familiar with with other applications.
- **Shapes**: Add lines, arrows, ovals and rectangles with any `Paint` and control them the same as **text**.

In `flutter_painter`, these are called **drawables**.

`flutter_painter` also allows you to choose a color or an image for the background of your drawing. You can export your painting as an image.


## Example

You can check out the example tab for an example on how to use the package.

The example is hosted [here](https://flutter-painter.web.app) if you want to try it out yourself!

## Usage
First, you'll need a `PainterController` object. The `PainterController` controls the different drawables, the background you're drawing on and provides the `FlutterPainter` widget with the settings it needs. Then, in your UI, use the `FlutterPainter` widget with the controller assigned to it.

```dart
class ExampleWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const ExampleWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _ExampleWidgetState createState() => _ExampleWidgetState();
}

class _ExampleWidgetState extends State<ExampleWidget> {
  PainterController controller = PainterController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizedBox(
      width: 300,
      height: 300,
      child: FlutterPainter(
        controller: controller,        
        // You can also listen to callbacks here.
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

Note that `FlutterWidget` does not define its own constraints on its size, so it is advised to use a widget that can provide its child with size constraints, such as `SizedBox` or `AspectRatio` ([more on constraints here](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/constraints)).

### Callbacks

`FlutterPainter` has some helpful callbacks that are called when internal changes happen in the widget itself.
- `onDrawableCreated`: Called when a drawable is created from `FlutterPainter`. Passes the drawable as an arugment.
- `onDrawableDeleted`: Called when a drawable is deleted from `FlutterPainter`. Passes the drawable as an arugment.
- `onSelectedObjectDrawableChanged`: Called when the selected object drawable changes. This can be useful if you want to display some UI to edit the object's properties. Passes the selected object drawable as an argument.
- `onPainterSettingsChanged`: Called when the settings of `PainterController` are changed from `FlutterPainter` itself. Passes the new settings as an argument.


## `PainterController`

The `PainterController` is the heart of the operation of `flutter_painter`. It controls the settings for `FlutterPainter`, its background, and all of its drawables.

All setters on `PainterController` directly notify your `FlutterPainter` to respond and repaint. However, note that if you also respond to changes in the different fields of the controller, you'll need to use `setState` to re-build *your* widget.

> **NOTE:** If you are using multiple painters, make sure that each `FlutterPainter` widget has its own `PainterController`, **do not** use the same controller for multiple painters.

### Settings

There are currently three types of settings:
- `freeStyleSettings`: They control the parameters used in drawing scribbles, such as the width and color. It also has a field to enable/disable scribbles, to prevent the user from drawing on the `FlutterPainter`.
- `textSettings`: They mainly control the `TextStyle` of the text being drawn. It also has a focus node field ([more on focus nodes here](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/forms/focus)) to allow you to detect when the user starts and stops editing text.
- `objectSettings`: These settings control objects that can be moved, scaled and rotated. Texts are considered objects (they are currently the only ones, but there are plans to add more in the future, such as images). It controls layout assist, which allows to center objects and rotate them at a right angle, and settings regarding the object controls for scaling, rotating and resizing.
- `shapeSettings`: These control the paint and shape factory used (Shape Factory is used to create shapes), and whether the shape is drawn once or continiously.

You can provide initial settings for the things you want to draw through the settings parameter in the constructor of the `PainterController`.

All of the settings objects are immutable and cannot be modified, so in order to change some settings, you'll have to create a copy of your current settings and apply the changes you need (this is similar to how you would copy `ThemeData`). For example, this is how you would change the stroke width for your scribbles:
```dart
void setStrokeWidth(double value){
  controller.freeStyleSettings = controller.freeStyleSettings.copyWith(
    strokeWidth: value
  );
}
```

### Background


You can also provide a background for the `FlutterPainter` widget from the controller. You can either use a color or an image as a background.

In order to use a color, you can simply call the `backgroundDrawable` getter on any color.
```dart
void setBackground(){
  // Sets the background to the color black
  controller.background = Colors.black.backgroundDrawable;
}
```

In order to use an image, you will need an `Image` object from the dart library `dart:ui`. Since Flutter has an `Image` type from the Material package, we'll refer to the image type we need as `ui.Image`.
```dart
import 'dart:ui' as ui;
ui.Image? myImage;
```

In order to get the `ui.Image` object from usual image sources (file, asset, network), you can use an [`ImageProvider`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/ImageProvider-class.html) with the `image` getter (Examples of `ImageProvider`: [`FileImage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/FileImage-class.html), [`MemoryImage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/MemoryImage-class.html), [`NetworkImage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/NetworkImage-class.html)). This getter returns a future.

Then, you can use the `backgroundDrawable` getter on the `ui.Image`.
```dart
void setBackground() async {
  // Obtains an image from network and creates a [ui.Image] object
  final ui.Image myImage = await NetworkImage('https://picsum.photos/960/720').image;
  // Sets the background to the image
  controller.background = myImage.backgroundDrawable;
}
```

The background can also be assigned from the constructor of `PainterController` directly.

### Drawables

All the drawables drawn on `FlutterPainter` are stored and controller by the `PainterController`. On most use cases, you won't need to interact with the drawables directly. However, you may add your own drawables however you wish (without the user actually drawing them).

You can assign an initial list of `drawables` from the `PainterController` constructor to initialize the controller with them. You can also modify them from the controller, **but be careful**, use the methods from the `PainterController` itself and don't modify the `drawables` list directly.

**DO:**
```dart
void addMyDrawables(List<Drawable> drawables){
  controller.addDrawables(drawables);
}
```


**DON'T:**
```dart
void addMyDrawables(List<Drawable> drawables){
  controller.drawables.addAll(drawables);
}
```

### Rendering Image

From the `PainterController`, you can render the contents of `FlutterPainter` as a PNG-encoded `ui.Image` object. In order to do that, you need to provide the size of the output image. All the drawings will be scaled according to that size.

From the `ui.Image` object, you can convert it into a raw bytes list (`Uint8List`) in order to display it with `Image.memory` or save it as a file.

```dart
Uint8List? renderImage(Size size) async {
  final ui.Image renderedImage = await controller.renderImage(size);
  final Uint8List? byteData = await renderedImage.pngBytes;
  return byteData;
}
```

## Notes

- The `html` renderer for Flutter Web is not supported, and using it will cause unexpected behavior and errors (also includes the `auto` renderer which chooses the renderer depending on the device). If you're using it for Flutter Web, make sure to use `--web-renderer canvaskit` as an argument for your `run`/`build` commands. If you need to use `auto` or `html` for any reason (such as better performance), consider using another package.


- Testing is not available right now because I'm not familiar with it.
